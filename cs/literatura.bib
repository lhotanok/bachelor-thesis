  abstract  = {Existing approaches to recipe generation are unable to create recipes for users with culinary preferences but incomplete knowledge of ingredients in specific dishes. We propose a new task of personalized recipe generation to help these users: expanding a name and incomplete ingredient details into complete natural-text instructions aligned with the user{'}s historical preferences. We attend on technique- and recipe-level representations of a user{'}s previously consumed recipes, fusing these {`}user-aware{'} representations in an attention fusion layer to control recipe text generation. Experiments on a new dataset of 180K recipes and 700K interactions show our model{'}s ability to generate plausible and personalized recipes compared to non-personalized baselines.},
